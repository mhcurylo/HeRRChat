# HeRRChat

A simple react redux chat for HeRR and for FRRau.

It is a working skeleton.

I have to rethink the structure, write tests for redesign and re implement.

In this moment there is NO memory management. Watch out when deploying or using for a long time.

To check it out: in Server/ npm run start
            in Client/ webpack-dev-server



Loosely Based upon the excellent full-stack redux-react tutorial:
